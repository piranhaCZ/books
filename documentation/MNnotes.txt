NOTES:
- Clean (at least) small piece of data so data scientist/analyst can start working on basic scripts and testing on small piece of data.
- Prepare test data (with a few rows to check script, but is it nescessary to test it also on large datasets to check script efficient)
- Check data source page (origin - data from crawling - quality probably won't be the best)
- Quick check out data (format, data content, missing data, NULL values etc.) 
- Run script in Test Environment (
		-> check outputs and dtypes,
		-> if object = there can be null values, 
		-> check null values (why null values) in general, fill null values with default value)
		-> identify corrupted rows and decide what is wrong (e.g. "\"")
- diagrams created in Draw.io
- App in Python Django
- Loading is exactly from files - but should be: files upload -> data cleaning (cleaning according to usage or intentions) -> upload to database -> make analysis with clean data



QUESTIONS: --> important if it should be used only once or more times

Data intention
- Where should be data moved? How we want to use them? only in web app? ? 
- One time use, X-time use app?? UI App (W3C)? What should be script output?? only ten best? Environment (laptop, phone...)?
- Permission to use data - open source but we should let know author our names
- Fast analysis or Detail analysis or both
- How to check data are up to date?
- Do we want to add any other data source?
- Regular data update(e.g. every second Monday)? Automatically? Manually?

Data source
- Books source (system, manually)? -- download automaticaly zip file from web - web crawling.
 
Data correction:
- nescessary to clean data in detail? 
- books in diff language than english (sum) 
- unify authors? Unify books (x books with same name (similar name) - diff publish-year)
- &amp
- special chars - probably corrupted file (german, french encodong - utf-8 doesn't work)
- source data Users - missing name collumns (Country x County), need add other table "Location to unify location etc. 



IMPROVEMENTS:
- work with ratings - one person more ratings - valid date
- add book picture (what if there is more publish year? use the latest one?
- unify name books
- unify authors (J.R.R. Tolkie, J.r.r.TOLKIEN)
- include also 0 ratings in some ways
- search according to one or more books( what if books will be totally different genre??)
- there should be definitely info about book series (linking series together - If I read 1st LoR it should offer next two LoR books as a main option)

Improvements below would need detail system and other data sources (web crawling - not many options cause it is usually prohibited on websites) 
- script base also on genre and inside-bookwords (key words) (Tolkien vs Harry Potter - people who likes tolkien don't have to like Harry Potter because they are insterested in Middle Earth or Elves (whatever)
- include user's opinion if the books is similar or not
- would be great to test Graph Database (similar to looking for friends on social sites - looking for similar books)
